/**
 * Create a functional component that renders an object of users extracted from context using
 * Reactâ€™s useContext() hook. The objectâ€™s keys are the users' names and the associated values are booleans
 * that indicate whether the users are online or offline.
 * The object should be defined in the parent componentâ€™s state and the object, as well as its associated
 * setState() function, should be provided to the aforementioned functional component via context.
 * Again, userState and setUserState() should be passed to the child of their enclosing component via context.
 * The child should extract userState and setUserState() using the useContext() hook.
 * It should display each userâ€™s name alongside an icon indicating if the user is
 * online (ðŸŸ¢) or offline (ðŸ”´). Every two seconds, the component should change the status of a random user to the
 * opposite of their current status.
